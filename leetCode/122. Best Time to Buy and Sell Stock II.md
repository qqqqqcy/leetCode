# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Say you have an array for which the i<sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## code

```js

/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function(prices =[]) {
    // buy[i] 持有 i 情况下的最大收益
    // sell[i] 卖出 i 情况下的最大收益
    const buy = new Array(),sell = new Array()
    for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
        buy[i] = 0
        sell[i] = 0
    }
    let maxProfit = 0

    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            sell[i] = Math.max(sell[i],buy[j]+prices[i]-prices[j])
            buy[i] = Math.max(buy[i],sell[j])
            maxProfit = Math.max(sell[i],maxProfit)
        }
    }
    return maxProfit
};
```

## analysis

Simple DP

For each day, there are only two states of buying and selling. (Buying will not reduce the income)

Use buy [i], sell [i] to represent the maximum gain on buying and holding on day i. then:

- sell[i] = buy[j]+prices[i]-prices[j]
- buy[i] = sell[j]

Take the optimal value every time
