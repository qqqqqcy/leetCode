# 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:**

- The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of** edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about `how a graph is represented`.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
`1 <= numCourses <= 10^5`

## code

```js
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {number[]} preorder
 * @param {number[]} inorder
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var buildTree = function(preorder, inorder) {
    function run(preL,preR,inL,inR) {
        if (preL>preR || preL<0 || preR>preorder.length ) return null
        if (inL>inR || inL<0 || inR>inorder.length ) return null
     
        const curNode = new TreeNode(preorder[preL])
        const inorderIndex = inorder.indexOf(preorder[preL])
        if (preL===preR) return curNode
        curNode.left = run(preL+1,preL+inorderIndex-inL,inL,inorderIndex-1)
        curNode.right = run(preL+inorderIndex-inL+1,preR,inorderIndex+1,inR)
        return curNode
    }
    if (!preorder) return null
    return run(0,preorder.length-1,0,preorder.length-1)
};
