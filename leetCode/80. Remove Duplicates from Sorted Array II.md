# 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II(删除排序数组中的重复项 II)

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```bash
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```bash
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],

Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```js
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

## code

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeDuplicates = function (nums) {
    if (nums.length < 2) return nums
    let t = 2
    for (let h = 2; h < nums.length; h++) {
        if (nums[h] !== nums[t - 2]) {
            nums[t] = nums[h]
            t++
        }
    }
    nums.length = t
};
```
